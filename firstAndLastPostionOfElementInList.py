# Problem statement
# You are given a non-decreasing array 'arr' consisting of 'n' integers and an integer 'x'. You need to find the first and last position of 'x' in the array.



# Note:
# 1. The array follows 0-based indexing, so you need to return 0-based indices.
# 2. If 'x' is not present in the array, return {-1 -1}.
# 3. If 'x' is only present once in the array, the first and last position of its occurrence will be the same.


# Example:
# Input:  arr = [1, 2, 4, 4, 5],  x = 4

# Output: 2 3

# Explanation: The given array’s 0-based indexing is as follows:
#  1      2     4     4     5
#  ↓      ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
#  0      1     2     3     4

# So, the first occurrence of 4 is at index 2, and the last occurrence of 4 is at index 3.
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Constraints:
#  1 <= n <= 10^4
# -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
# -10^9 <= x <= 10^9
#  Time Limit: 1sec


# Expected Time Complexity:
# Try to solve the problem in O(log(N)) time complexity.
# Sample Input 1:
# 5
# -10 -5 -5 -5 2
# -5
# Sample Output 1:
# 1 3
# Explanation for Sample Input 1:
# The given array’s 0-based indexing is as follows:
# -10    -5    -5    -5     2
#  ↓      ↓     ↓     ↓     ↓
#  0      1     2     3     4

# So, the first occurrence of -5 is at index 1, and the last occurrence of -5 is at index 3.
# Sample Input 2:
# 4
# 1 2 3 4
# -1
# Sample Output 2:
# -1 -1
# Explanation for Sample Input 2:
# The given array 'arr' is:[1, 2, 3, 4] and 'x' = -1.
# In this case 'x' is not present in the array.
# Hence, we return {-1,-1}.
